Accrual vs Cash
===============

Akaunting uses accrual basis accounting to show the reports in the dashboard. Let's see what does it mean and why it's been choosen:

### Accrual accounting

Incomes are reported in the fiscal period they're earned, **regardless of when they're received**, and expenses are deducted in the fiscal period they're incurred, **whether they are paid or not**. 

### Cash accounting

Incomes are recorded when cash is **actually received** and expenses are recorded when they are **actually paid** (no matter when they were actually invoiced).

In short, accrual basis accounting gives the most accurate picture of the financial status of your business.
