Overview
======

If you track your business bookkeeping using pen and paper or excel sheets, we recommend entering your business' accounting transactions into Akaunting by starting with the fiscal year. If you track your accounting in an excel sheet, you can import your data easily by following the steps on this page > Import and Export.

If you previously used a different accounting tool, you can migrate your data usingÄ± the migration modules. Migration apps can be found in the [App Store](https://akaunting.com/apps/categories/import-export). You can find steps to migrate them in the description of the related module.
