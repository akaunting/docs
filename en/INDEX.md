### Developers

Akaunting is built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework, make sure you've got how it works first. The [modules](https://akaunting.com/docs/2.0/developer-manual/modules) article is the essential of developing apps. Then you can check how to show your app in navigation [menu](https://akaunting.com/docs/2.0/developer-manual/menu). Akaunting ships with fine-grained [permissions](https://akaunting.com/docs/2.0/developer-manual/permissions) and it's crucial to implement them into your app. [RESTful API](https://akaunting.com/docs/2.0/developer-manual/restful-api) is one of the most important parts of Akaunting.
