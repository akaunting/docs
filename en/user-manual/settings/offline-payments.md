Offline Payments
================

Offline payments are generally used by admins to categorize the method through which they receive payments. They can also be used to show offline payment details to customers. For example, you can create a Bank Transfer payment method and enter your bank account details so that your customer may transfer the invoice amount.

Offline Payments page is located under **Settings > Offline Payments** page. On this page, you can see all offline payments, create a new one, edit the current ones and delete them.
