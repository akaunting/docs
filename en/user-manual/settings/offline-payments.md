Offline Payments
=========

This payment method is defined by a user associated with either Cash or Bank Transfer as default. Admins generally use offline payments to categorize the method they receive payments. They can also be used to show offline payment details to customers. 
For example, you can create a Bank Transfer payment method and enter your bank account details so that your customer may transfer the invoice amount.

You can create a new offline payment method on this page, edit the current ones or delete them. 
   
On the left section, you can create new payment methods as follows:
- **Name**: Payment method name.
- **Code**: Payment method code.
- **Order**: The sorting order of the payment method. 
- **Show to the customer**: You can enable this if you want this payment method to be available as an option to your customers.
