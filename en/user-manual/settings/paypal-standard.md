PayPal Standard
=========

Paypal Standard allows you to accept debit and credit card payments from Paypal.
To accept payment, you need a Paypal business account. With Paypal standard, you can sync with Akaunting in the settings.
(Getting a Paypal business account is easy, as you only need to convert an existing Personal account to Business)
