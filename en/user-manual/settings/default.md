Default
=========

Set the default for Account, Currency, Payment method, Income category, and more. If you have multiple companies, please note that each company has its defaults Settings page, and you would have to switch between companies for this. (You can switch between your companies by clicking the company name on the top left side). 
While creating an account, you set up your companies based currency. If you change your company's currency, your report's default currency will also change. Hence, you should adjust currency rates.

Below are the defaults you can adjust:
