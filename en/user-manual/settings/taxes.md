Tax is used to apply fees to invoices and bills for different tax classes. When creating an invoice or a bill, Akaunting calculates taxes based on the type of tax. 

You can name, select a tax, and enter the rate or the amount according to the type. For example, VAT or Sales Tax is a regular tax of a percentage that is calculated over the sales price and added to the bill.

Akaunting calculates compounding, fixed amount, inclusive, and withholding tax, as well as the normal tax.
