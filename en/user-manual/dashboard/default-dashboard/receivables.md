Receivables
=========

The Receivables section displays the amount you're yet to receive from your customers. The section is divided into two parts:

- **Open**: The total amount of invoices you have created for the selected timeframe and expect to receive within the due date.
- **Overdue**: The number of invoices you're yet to receive after the due date has passed. You can see more details about the outstanding invoices by clicking on more details.

You can deep dive into the information by clicking on View Report.
