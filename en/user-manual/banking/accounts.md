Accounts

You can see a list of your accounts under Banking>Accounts. On the Accounts page, you can create, edit or delete accounts. 
Each transaction changes the amount of cash in your account(s). 

At the top right corner of the Accounts page, you'll find the New Account and Connect Your Bank buttons. The New Account button allows you to add new accounts for everyday transactions on Akaunting. At the same time, [Connect Your Bank](https://akaunting.com/apps/bank-feeds) lets you automatically import your bank transactions into Akaunting through the Bank Feeds feature on the [Premium Plan](http://akaunting.com/plans).
