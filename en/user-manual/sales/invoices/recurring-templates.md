Recurring Invoice
=========

You will see the recurring templates in the second tab on the Invoice page. Here all recurring invoices templates are listed. 

Create a recurring invoice by clicking on New Recurring Invoice. On the New Recurring Invoice Page, enter the required details on the available fields and select the frequency.

The recurring invoice will be created automatically based on your selected option of Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly. You can choose a custom option and enter your preferred frequency. 

The recurring invoice will be generated as a draft, and you should add your payment details manually. When the invoice is generated, it will be listed under the invoice tab. Editing your recurring invoice template won't affect the previously generated invoice based on the old template.
