Invoices
=========

An invoice is a commercial document that contains a list of items (products or services) with their cost for payment at a later time. You are running a business to provide solutions and record sales; hence, creating an invoice is one of the most used actions in Akaunting. Invoices are located under Sales. 

At the top of the Invoices page, you will see the overview of all your invoices. Here, all invoices are listed and can be sorted by date, Status, or amount.

To create an invoice, click on the New Invoice button at the top of the Invoices page and fill out the fields. Although some fields are not required, they make it easier to track your reports. 

When creating an invoice, you need to enter the recipient of the invoice through the "Add a customer" option and fill in other mandatory fields like the invoice date, due date, and number.
 You add items by selecting from your list of items and also add discounts/taxes for each item on an invoice. 
Below the items section, you can also enter an overall discount for items listed on an Invoice.

After creating an invoice, you can send it at that time or save it and send it later from the invoices page. 

While sending an invoice, enter a custom message in the pop-up email box. 
After sending an Invoice, you view an invoice page that displays details such as the date, the recipient, and the payment status.

The Status of an invoice changes automatically when the recipient confirms payment or views the invoice. You can also update the status of an invoice manually by clicking the "add payment" button. 
If, for some reason, an invoice recipient confirms payment, however, you are yet to receive payment, you can click on "delete payment" on the selected invoice page to undo the transaction.
