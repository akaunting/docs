Customers are the source of a business's income, making them an essential part of your business operations.
You can view the list of all customers under the Sales section. You can add, edit, enable, disable, delete, export, or duplicate a customer. 

At the top of the Customers page, you'll find the New Customer and CRM buttons. The New Customer option allows you to create new customers, while the [CRM option](https://akaunting.com/apps/crm?utm_source=suggestion&utm_medium=app&utm_campaign=crm) lets you create deals. You can add customers by selecting the New Customer button or clicking on the More option to import a list of customers using the XLS or XLSX sheet format.
