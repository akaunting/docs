Dashboard
=========

Dashboard is the first thing you will see when entering Akaunting. It is an adjustable view that contains many types of information widgets, such as income/expense/profit totals, cash flow, incomes/expenses by category, latests incomes/expense, and more added by apps. You can have several dashboards that serve different purposes. You can also switch between them.

Widgets show the accrued incomes and expenses, except Cash Flow chart. [Here](https://akaunting.com/docs/faq/accrual-vs-cash) you can learn more about cash and accrual accounting.

## Multiple Dashboards

You can have several dashboards that serve different purposes, switch between, and share them with your staff/accountant. To create a dashboard, click on the horizontal ellipsis (three dots) nearby the **Dashboard** word. Then, select the **Create Dashboard** option.

After adding new dashboards, the *Dashboard* menu will turn into a dropdown menu from where you can switch between dashboards.

## Apps

Apps can also create a seperate dashboard with their specific widgets. For example, the [CRM](https://akaunting.com/apps/crm) app creates its own dashboard with widgets concentrated in customer relationship. The same process is available for [Payroll](https://akaunting.com/apps/payroll), [Double-Entry](https://akaunting.com/apps/double-entry), and lots of apps.
