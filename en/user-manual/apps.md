App Store
=========

While we strongly believe that Akaunting is the best free accounting software, we're also aware it's not perfect. Akaunting ships with core accounting tools needed to manage money. For added features, we've created a modular structure so that it could be extended easily, instead of creating a bloated software by adding all of them to the core.

For example, an app can connect your online store built with WooCommerce so that products, customers, and orders could get transferred to Akaunting automatically. Another one may connect with a CRM. And another one may be a payment gateway such as PayPal, Stripe etc to be used on the client side of Akaunting software to pay invoices online.

## API Key

In order to access the App Store from your Akaunting software installation, and install the apps you've purchased, you will need to get your [API Key](https://akaunting.com/dashboard) and enter it when you are prompted to provide it. It is the bridge between the software and site (akaunting.com).

## Buy

Apps can be free or paid. Paid apps are sold under a yearly subscription plan.

After you click on the *Buy Now* button, you'll be redirected to *akaunting.com* site to make the payment. After the payment process is finished, you'll be redirected back to your Akaunting installation and you'll be able to install the app within one click, no need for download-upload etc. You can always access their files from *modules* directory.

You can always cancel your subscription from the [subscriptions](https://akaunting.com/subscriptions) page. In such a case, you can still continue to use the app but at the end of subscription period, you won't get support and updates.
