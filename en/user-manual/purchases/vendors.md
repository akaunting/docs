Vendors
=========

A Vendor or Seller supplies items (product and service) to your business, which requires you to create a bill. 

You can see a complete list of your vendors by clicking on the Vendors option listed under Purchases. 

On the vendor's page, you see a summary of bills grouped into Overdue, Open, and Draft.

At the top right of the page, you can find the New Vendor, [Payroll](https://akaunting.com/apps/payroll?utm_source=suggestion&utm_medium=app&utm_campaign=payroll), and More options.
You can add vendors by selecting the New Vendor button or clicking on the More option to import a list of vendors using XLS or XLSX sheet format.


When creating a new vendor, the following fields are displayed:

- **Name**: Vendor's name.
- **Email**: Vendor's email address.
- **Phone**: Vendor's phone number.
- **Website**: Vendor's website.
- **Reference**: Specify or reference number or name
- **Picture**: Vendor's image to be used in bills as the logo.

Also, when creating a new vendor, there's a [Custom Fields](https://akaunting.com/apps/custom-fields?utm_source=suggestion&utm_medium=app&utm_campaign=custom_fields) button at the top page, which helps you add custom fields to vendor data.

After creating a new vendor, you can see a list of your vendors on the Vendors home page.
By checking the Checkbox next to a listed Vendor on the Vendors page, you get the options to enable, disable, delete or export a vendor.

A mouse hover on a listed vendor reveals the options to show, edit, duplicate or delete a vendor.

Viewing the Vendors profile, you can see all the bills and transactions associated with a vendor. 

You can complete the following actions to create a new vendor.
