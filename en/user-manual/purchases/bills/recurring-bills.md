Recurring Bills
=========

You will see the recurring templates in the second tab on the Bills page. Here, all typical bill templates are listed. 

Create a recurring Bill by clicking on New Recurring Bill. On the New Recurring Bill Page, enter the required details on the available fields and select the frequency.

The recurring bill will be created automatically based on your selected frequency of Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly. You can choose a custom option and enter your preferred frequency.

The recurring bill will be generated as a draft, and you should update the payment details manually. When the bill is generated, it will be listed under the Bills tab. It won't affect a previously generated bill if you edit your recurring bills template.
