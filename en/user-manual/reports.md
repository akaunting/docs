Reports
=======

Reports allows you to get detailed financial data and help you better visualize all the information you need to improve your business. It gives you as a business owner a good idea of where your business income stands, month by month, and categorised.

All reports are displayed under the default currency. Income and expenses created under a different currency will be converted based on the currency rate at the time they were created.

In the home page of reports, you can see the report name, it's total amount, description, and the horizontal ellipsis (three dots) that allows you to edit/delete the report.
