Add New Organization
=========

On the top left, you'll see the name of your company. You can set up new companies by clicking on the name. You get a dropdown with two menu options:

- **Your company name**: Clicking on this takes you to your accounting dashboard.
- **Manage Companies**: Clicking on this takes you to where you can set up a new company or edit an existing company.
