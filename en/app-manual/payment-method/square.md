> Secure payment processing for your invoices

[Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) is a financial services, merchant services aggregator, and payment company used by 2 million businesses.

This app allows your customers to pay their invoices online via Squareup.com, a secure and easy way to accept credit/debit cards online. We don't get any commission fees.

It will also accurately import/sync any Square payment received from Reader, POS or another Square method out of Akaunting and convert them to invoices automatically. So you'll save the time spent on manual updates, CSV imports, etc. You can also sync the current ones manually.

Accept every payment quickly, easily, and securely.
