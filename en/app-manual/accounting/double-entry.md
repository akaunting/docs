An opening balance is the amount of funds in an account at the beginning of a new fiscal period.

To set the opening balance, create a new entry from **Double-Entry > Journal Entry** page. Select the account for which you're setting the opening balance as first and the **Owner Contribution/Equity** (or an appropriate Equity) account as second. Then:

1. If the opening balance account (first) is an **asset** (i.e. accounts receivable, bank, credit card), enter the amount as a **debit**.

2. If the opening balance account (first) is a **liability** (i.e. accounts payable), enter the amount as a **credit**.
